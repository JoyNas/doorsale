Built With
==========

* Django_: web development framework for python, we utilizes full stack.

* LESS_: styling totally done in LESS, a preprocessor for CSS.

* Django-Pipeline_: we use django-pipeline to compile & compress LESS and also
  compress Javascript before deployment.

* PostgreSQL_: I would recommend to use PostgreSQL for production, but project
  intended to support all databases that Django supports. SQLite_ is good
  alternative for small sites, let say 1000 orders per week won't break a sweat,
  see limit_ for SQLite for more details, but it has lacks good tools for
  administration
